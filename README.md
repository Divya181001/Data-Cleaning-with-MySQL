# Data Cleaning Project: Chemicals in Cosmetics

## Overview:
This project aims to clean and preprocess a dataset obtained from Kaggle, focusing on the topic of chemicals used in cosmetics. The objective is to ensure data integrity, consistency, and quality for further analysis and modeling.

## Dataset Description:
Check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/chemicals-in-cosmetics-what-s-really-in-your).

- **Source:** The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning resources.
  
- **Content:** The dataset contains information about chemicals found in various cosmetics products, including details such as Chemical ID, Chemical Name, Product Name, Company Details, Date Records and many more.
  
 - **Size:** The dataset consists of 114,298 rows and 23 columns.
   
## Tools and Technologies:
- **MySQL Workbench:** Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis tasks.
  
- **SQL:** Leveraged for querying, filtering, transforming, and cleaning the dataset.

## Steps Involved:
1. Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and potential issues.
2. Data Cleaning: Identifying and addressing missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers.
3. Normalization: Ensuring data consistency and standardization across fields, such as company names, Brand names, and chemical names.
4. Validation: Verifying data accuracy and integrity through cross-validation and sanity checks.
5. Transformation: Converting data types, aggregating information, and creating derived features for analysis purposes.
6. Quality Assurance: Reviewing the cleaned dataset to ensure it meets the desired quality standards for further analysis.

## Conclusion:
Through rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing efforts using MySQL Workbench, this project successfully addressed issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the cosmetics dataset. The resulting cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and modeling, enabling insights into the chemicals used in cosmetics products and their associated attributes.
